Drone Control Code Description
This repository contains code designed to control a drone, enabling it to perform various flight maneuvers and interact with its sensors. The code is written in C++,and is compatible with DJI f450.

Key features of the code include:

Drone Initialization: Configures initial parameters, establishing communication with the drone's hardware systems such as motors, GPS, and sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes).

Flight Control: Implements algorithms to manage the drone's movements, such as takeoff, landing, ascending, descending, yaw (turning), pitch, and roll, through motor speed adjustments and directional commands.

Sensors & Navigation: Interacts with onboard sensors, like GPS, ultrasonic sensors, and cameras, for stability control and obstacle avoidance. The code may include algorithms for autonomous flight based on sensor feedback.

Waypoint Navigation: Allows the drone to follow predefined flight paths using GPS waypoints, making it suitable for applications like surveying, mapping, and delivery.

Monitoring & Feedback: Includes functions to monitor battery levels, altitude, speed, and other critical parameters, with real-time feedback to ensure safe operation. Alerts or fail-safes can be triggered for low battery, GPS signal loss, or other issues.

User Interface: Provides an interface for the user to send commands, either via a remote controller, a mobile app, or a command-line interface (CLI).

Emergency Handling: Implements fail-safes for emergency scenarios, such as automatic return-to-home (RTH) in case of signal loss or automatic motor shutdown during critical errors.
